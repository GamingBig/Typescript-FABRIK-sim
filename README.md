# Typescript FABRIK simulation

## WARNING:
This is not by any means a proper simulation of physics, it's made in 2 days, with minimal effort in legability or optimisation.

<br>
If you want a proper simulation, use <a href="https://brm.io/matter-js/">Matter.js</a>

## Requirements if you want to edit the code:
- Typescript
- Understanding of Javascript
